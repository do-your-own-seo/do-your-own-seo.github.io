h1: "Some SEO theory and DIY tricks"
---
<p>The idea of the blog is to talk about running a website yourself and optimizing it for search engines. I hope to make things clear but refrain from unnecessary simplifications so that the information doesn’t lose its practical sense. It’s not about promoting your website on social networks but about mutual understanding with search bots and ranking algorithms. Dedicated to all who:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <span class = "under">prefers to go into the matter in depth</span> rather than constantly ask for help;</li>
	<li> <span class = "under">understands that increasing traffic</span> requires careful preparation;</li>
	<li> <span class = "under">has the enthusiasm to win the search competition</span> and get user clicks.</li>
</ul>
