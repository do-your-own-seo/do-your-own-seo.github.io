keywords: "about the blog"
description: "It’s a multilingual Jekyll blog about the Web and search engines. Created for fun & with the hope of helping someone optimize the site on their own &#9874; Wellcome; I hope it’ll be fun"

intro: "Hi! This is where the notes on SEO might appear. I don’t mean to disappoint the reader&thinsp;, but such topics as “to the Top of Google Search in a month”  won’t be covered. The main issues to consider are website health and the ability to compete in Search regardless of any search engine updates."

<div>
<p>Let me introduce to you my little homemade blog. It’s a static site hosted on GitHub pages. Every time a new post is created (or a dumb error is found), GitHub Actions call Jekyll to rebuild the site from the source repo. I like Tech SEO, Javascript, and read your comments below the posts. I’m reticent about jQuery, Bootstrap, Disqus, Facebook, <del>and linkbuilding</del>. That’s why all the scripts here are written in good old plain Javascript (and are long out of date, because I don’t have enough time to bring the code into compliance with ECMAScript 2022). And most importantly, <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a>: it’s an ingenious commenting system that requires no server! 
</p>
<h1>What the blog is about</h1>
<p>In short, this blog is about websites and search engines. It’s not intended for monetization. So why do I do it?</p>
<p>Because I like the Web, both as an idea and an implementation. I want to see useful, beautiful, and fast websites when searching the net for work or hobby purposes.</p>
<p>Because I’m into website optimization and web search workflow, doing my best to turn the SEO routine into a pleasure.</p>
<p>I believe everyone agrees: <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization does not mean the Optimization-<b>for</b>-Search-Engines. AI-powered search systems  process natural language, detect entities, determine intents, predict needs, and recognize images. Besides, they are updated almost daily. That is why website optimization recommendations, based on SERP statistics, quickly but quietly become outdated.</p>
<p>Here is my sketchy explanation of the main tasks of today’s SEO.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Website optimization for... people, bots, and browsers.</li>
  <li>Examination of working and evolution principles of the web search.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="under"><strong>A) + B) = SEO =</strong> </span> Representation of the web resource in a way comprehensible to search engines, without detriment of common (human) sense.</p>
<p>You cannot force self-learning systems to appreciate your site until they understand it. Well, you can trick them or feed them with a “keyword soup” for ranking purposes, but not for long: machine intelligence might eat even “soap”, yet only till it accidentally tastes something else.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="for">Who is it for</h2>
<p>Like any website, this blog will be glad to meet every new reader. However, SEO publications will be addressed to non-professionals. Why? Because there are people engaged in small business or socially significant activities. They can easily explain their goals and successfully communicate with the audience through social media. Although everything goes well, everybody understands it’s time to expand their online presence.</p>
<p>Starting a website is easy, but when it comes to promotion... Either it emerges that the site is technically unsuitable for optimization, or the price set by the big SEO company turns out to be a barrier for small businesses.</p>
<p>Thus, the blog is for those <strong>who manage the website on their own</strong> or are <strong>just planning to create one</strong>.</p>
<p>Alas, these pages are unlikely to become the complete course kinda “SEO from scratch”: I don’t have a vocation for teaching and sufficient competence on several issues. What I can do is write about what I’m interested in and try to make the blog helpful to someone.</p>
<p class="txt-center"><strong class="green">The message to “SEO layman”</strong></p>
<p>That is, to everyone who, besides the communal apartment (i.e., social media account), wants to get the new spacious house – own website.</p>
<ol><li><span>Please, don’t consider yourself a newcomer or outsider. Many SEO specialists have academic specializations that have nothing to do with Web and digital marketing.</span></li>
<li><span>To understand how web search works, you don’t have to imagine the structure of search engines.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t need to learn the terms used in SEO case studies. What’s important is to grasp the fundamentals and look at the website through the eyes of machines&#160;<i class="icon icon-wink"></i> (intelligent, of course).</span></li>
<li><span>No matter how much you read about SEO: it’s better to learn by practice.</span></li>
<li><span>The main exercises will be: to fill the site with content, maintain social activity and Google Maps account, and make contacts with other web resources. For what? For links to your pages to appear on related websites.</span></li>
<li><span>Writing and web promotion takes time, as well as technical tasks of website code optimization.</span></li>
<li><span>If you aren’t ready for challenges apart from your primary job, you might want to find an assistant. Good idea, but taking the first steps in SEO better together.</span></li></ol>
<h2  id="future">What would you like the Internet to be in a few years?</h2>
<p><span class="under">Future #1</span>. Google responds to 99% of search queries on its own without directing the user to other resources. You no longer need to surf in search of entertainment: the all-knowing AI assistant will tell you it’s time to go to the cinema and offer a movie that you’ll definitely enjoy. The suited laundry service is also automatically suggested based on your location history and local business reviews. </p>
<p><span class="under">Future #2</span>. The Internet is another name for freedom of choice and expression, the living environment for cooperation, study, and all kind of businesses. People and organizations launch websites to tell their stories and offer more to the audience. Google crawls, indexes, ranks, and modifies rankings: all this for everyone to be heard.</p>
<p>Of course, the versions are already inseparable, and both will become part of our Tomorrow. But still, everyone can adjust the proportions in favor of their point of view.</p>
<p class="txt-right">Let’s try and see what happens!</p> <p>P.S. Although it is a personal blog, additions to the point are welcome. Please drop me a line if you have any thoughts.</p>
