intro: "Hi! This is where the notes on SEO could appear. I don't mean to disappoint the reader&thinsp;, but such topics as “to the Top of Google Search in a month” won't be covered. The main issues to consider are website health and the ability to compete in Search regardless of any search engine updates."

<h1>Why about SEO</h1>
<ul class="toc">
  <li><a href="#for">Who's it for</a>&emsp;</li>
  <li><a href="#future">What would you like the Internet to be?</a>&ensp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Because I like the Web – both as idea and as implementation. I want to see useful, beautiful, and fast websites when searching the net for work or hobby purposes.</p>
<p>Because I'm into optimization and web search workflow, doing my best to turn SEO routine into pleasure.</p>
<p>I believe many will agree: <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization is no longer the Optimization-<b>for</b>-Search-Engines. AI-powered search algorithms  process natural language, predict intents, describe and classify images, and are updated almost daily. That is why statistics-based SEO-recommendations quickly but quietly become outdated.</p>
<p>Here is a sketchy explanation of the main task of today's SEO.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Optimization for the Web.</li>
  <li>Examination of working principles and evolution of the web search.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="under"><strong>A) + B) = SEO =</strong> </span> Representation of the web resource in a way that is clear and understandable to search engines.</p>
<p>At the core of ranking are machine learning systems: you cannot force them to respect the site until they get to know it. Okay, you can trick machine intelligence or feed the engine with a soup of keywords, but not for long. The self-learning system might eat even soap, yet only till it accidentally tastes something else.</p></div>
<h2 id="for">Who is the blog for?</h2>
<p>Like any web site, this blog will be glad to meet every new reader. However, SEO publications will mostly be addressed to non-professionals. Why? Because there are people engaged in small business or socially significant activity. They can easily explain their goals and tasks and successfully communicate with the audience through social media. Although everything goes well, everybody understands that it's time to expand online presence.</p>
<p>Starting a website is easy, but when it comes to promotion... Either it emerges that the site is technically unsuitable for optimization, or the price set by the big SEO company turns out to be a barrier for small businesses.</p>
<p>Thereby the blog is for those <strong>who manage the website on their own</strong> or are <strong>just planning to create one</strong>.</p>
<p>Alas, these pages are unlikely to become the full course kinda “SEO from scratch”: I don't have a vocation for teaching as well as sufficient competence on several issues. What I can do is write about what I'm interested in and try to make it useful to somebody.</p>
<p class="txt-center"><strong class="olive">The message to “layman” in SEO</strong></p>
<p>That is, to everyone who wants to get besides the communal apartment (i.e., social media account), the new spacious house &ndash; own website.</p>
<ol><li><span>Please, don't consider yourself as a newcomer and outsider. Many SEO specialists have academic specializations that have nothing to do with digital marketing.</span></li>
<li><span>To understand how web search works, you don't have to see into the structure of search engines.</span></li>
<li><span>You don't need to learn the terms used in SEO case studies. What's important is to grasp the fundamentals and look at the Web through the eyes of machines (intelligent, of course).</span></li>
<li><span>No matter how much you read about SEO: it's better to learn by doing.</span></li>
<li><span>The main points are: to create and upgrade content, maintain social activity and Google-My-Business account, and make contacts with other resources. For what? For links to your pages to appear on related websites.</span></li>
<li><span>Writing and web promotion takes time, as well as technical aspects of optimization (we'll get to this later).</span></li>
<li><span>If you aren't ready for challenges apart from your primary job, you <span class="under">might want to find an assistant. </span> Good idea, but taking the first steps in SEO better together.</span></li></ol>
<h2  id="future">What would you like the Internet to be in a few years?</h2>
<p><span class="under">Future #1</span>. Google responds to 99% of search queries on its own without directing the user to other resources. You no longer need to surf in search of entertainment: the all-knowing AI-assistant tells you it's time to go to the cinema and offers the movie which you'll definitely enjoy. Even a suitable laundry service is also automatically suggested based on your location history and local business reviews. </p>
<p><span class="under">Future #2</span>. The Internet is another name for freedom of choice and expression, the living environment for cooperation, study, and all kind of businesses. People and organizations launch websites to tell their stories and offer more to the audience. Google crawls, indexes, ranks, and modifies the rank: all this for everyone to be heard.</p>
<p>Of course, the versions are already inseparable, and both will become part of our Tomorrow. But still, everyone can adjust the proportions in favor of their point of view.</p>
