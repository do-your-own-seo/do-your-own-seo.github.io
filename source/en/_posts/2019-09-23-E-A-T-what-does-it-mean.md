<ul class="toc txt-right"><li><a href="#fin">For those who may lose faith in their authoritativeness when reading this</a></li> </ul>

  <p>The fact is that the Search Engine will not consider a page to be trustworthy based on the quality of the publication alone. The trust also requires the significant professional authority of the post’s author and the reliability of the website as a whole. Below are the main theses of the <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html" rel="noopener">article on E-A-T concept</a> from GoogleBlog for webmasters and website owners.</p>
  <p class="txt-center"><strong>E-A-T &nbsp;=&nbsp; Expertise – Authoritativeness – Trustworthiness</strong></p>
  <p>It’s worth referring to the original post at least for sources for further study. However, you won’t find a strict theory there, since the technique of web search must remain behind the scenes.</p>
  <p>To predict whether the Search Engine will recommend your website to users, just answer the following questions. That is especially important for web-resources on <strong>medicine, finance, and other vital areas (YMYL, Your Money or Your Life topics)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Content is the King but the retinue plays an important role</h2>
<p><img class="fullscreen-right" src="/images/posts/writing.jpg" alt="Text content" loading="lazy" width="250" height="250"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the article contain novel information, some reports, or research data?</li>
  <li>Are all the aspects of the topic considered, and to what extent?</li>
  <li>Does the article provide analytical or factual data that cannot be called obvious?</li>
  <li>If the content relies on publicly accessible data, does it add value?</li>
  <li>Does the headline shock the reader, or does it try to attract with some wangled statements?</li>
  <li>Is it clear from the title what the article will be about?</li>
  <li>Would you share such content with your friends or save it as a bookmark in your browser?</li>
  <li>Do you expect this article to be referenced in a specialized journal, book, or encyclopedia?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The publisher is always under scrutiny</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are the primary sources indicated, and are the facts supported by evidence? In other words, is the content <strong>credible</strong>? <img class="fl-left" src="/images/posts/under-scrutiny.jpg" alt="Content publisher is under scrutiny" loading="lazy" width="160" height="160"></li>
  <li>Is this article really written by an expert? How is the <strong>author’s expertise</strong> confirmed?</li>
  <li>Is there a link to the author’s page or the editorial "About us" section?</li>
  <li>Aren’t there easily provable errors in the article?</li>
  <li>If you continued to surf the site, would you confirm that it is <strong>authoritative</strong> on the topic?</li>
  <li>Would you rely on such information in situations concerning health or finances?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The presentation matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are there grammatical or stylistic errors in the text?</li>
  <li>Are all the web pages neatly designed, or is the whole website just hastily slapped up?</li>
  <li>Is the content "mass-produced"? Maybe it is distributed through a vast network of sites so that the particular pages get lost among the similar ones?</li>
  <li>Is the site stuffed with advertising? Don’t the ads distract from the main content?</li>
  <li>Is the content properly displayed on most mobile devices?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparative questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does the page have a value in the context of other pages displayed on the SERP?</li>
  <li>Does the content serve the interests of users, or was it supposedly posted just because it should be well ranked?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s enough for now: for more explanation, see the <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">page quality rating guide</a> starting on p.18.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Are useful content and quality content always the same thing?</h2>
<p>Have you decided that you’ll never become an authority for Google in your life? No to depression! Not every online niche should have articles worthy of citation in paper encyclopedias. Commerce, tourism, and the entertainment industry don’t need them (let alone homemade cat videos).</p>
<p>In fact, Google understands that <strong>high-quality content</strong> and <strong>useful content</strong> are not always the same thing. The order they appear on the SERP will depend on how the Search Engine interprets the user’s current <b>needs and intents</b> (more on <a href="{{site.url}}/how-do-google-algorithms-work">ranking factors</a> read here).</p>

<p>Examples of useful but not too ingenious resources are</p>
<ul>
  <li>automatically translated into all the world languages clones of popular Q&A services;</li>
  <li>the paraphrase of some complex instructions or cooking recipes in simple words.</li>
</ul>
