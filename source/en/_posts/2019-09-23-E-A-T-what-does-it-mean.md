  <p>The fact is that the Search Engine's trust is based not only on the quality of the publication but also on the author's professional authority and the website's reliability as a whole. Below are the main theses of <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html" rel="noopener">the article on E-A-T concept</a> from GoogleBlog for website owners and webmasters.</p>
  <p class="txt-center"><strong>E-A-T &nbsp;=&nbsp; Expertise &ndash; Authoritativeness &ndash; Trustworthiness</strong></p>
  <p>It is worth referring to the original at least for sources for further study. However, you will not find a strict theory there, since the technique of the Search must remain behind the scenes.</p>
  <p>To understand whether the Search Engine will be able to recommend your resource to users, it'll be enough to answer the following questions. This is especially true for web resources on <strong>medicine, finance, and other vital areas</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Content is the King but the retinue plays an important role</h2>
<p><img class="fullscreen-right" src="/images/posts/writing.jpg" alt="Text content" loading="lazy"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the article contain some novel information, report, or research data?</li>
  <li>Are all the aspects of the topic considered, and to what extent?</li>
  <li>Does the article provide analytical or factual data that cannot be called obvious?</li>
  <li>If the content relies on publicly available data, does it add value, or does it simply paraphrase sources?</li>
  <li>Does the headline shock the reader, or does it try to attract attention with some wangled statements?</li>
  <li>Is it clear from the title what the article will be about?</li>
  <li>Would you share such content with your friends or save it as a bookmark in your browser?</li>
  <li>Do you assume that this article may be referenced in printed journals, books, or encyclopedias?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The publisher is always under scrutiny</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are the primary sources indicated and the facts supported by evidence? In other words, is the content <strong>credible</strong>? <img class="fl-left" src="/images/posts/under-scrutiny.jpg" alt="Content publisher is under scrutiny" loading="lazy"></li>
  <li>Is this article really written by an expert? How is the <strong>author's expertise</strong> confirmed?</li>
  <li>Is there a link to the author's page or the editorial "About us" section?</li>
  <li>Aren't there easily provable errors in the article?</li>
  <li>If you continued to surf the site, would you confirm that it's <strong>authoritative</strong> on the topic?</li>
  <li>Would you rely on such information in situations concerning health or finances?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The presentation matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are there grammatical or stylistic errors in the text?</li>
  <li>Are the pages of the site neatly designed or messed up somehow in haste?</li>
  <li>Isn't the content "mass-produced"? Maybe it is distributed through a vast network of sites so that the particular pages get lost among the similar ones?</li>
  <li>Isn't the site stuffed with advertising? Don't the ads distract from the main content?</li>
  <li>Is the content displayed properly on mobile devices?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparative questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does the page have a value in the context of other pages displayed on the SERP?</li>
  <li>Does the content really serve the interests of users, or is it supposedly posted just because it should rank well?</li>
</ul>
<p>That's enough for now. For more explanation, see the <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">page quality rating guide</a> starting on p.18.</p>
<h2 id="fin">For those who are discouraged by reading this</h2>
<p>No to depression! Not every online niche should have articles worthy of citation in paper encyclopedias. Commerce, tourism and the entertainment industry don't need them (let alone homemade cat videos).</p>
<p>In fact, Google understands that <strong>quality content</strong> and <strong>useful content</strong> are not always the same thing. The order they appear on the SERP will depend on how the Search Engine interprets the user's current <b>needs and intent</b> (more on <a href="{{site.url}}/how-do-google-algorithms-work">ranking factors</a> read here).</p>

<p>Examples of useful but not too ingenious resources are</p>
<ul>
  <li>automatically translated into all the world languages clones of popular Q&A services;</li>
  <li>the paraphrase of some complex instructions or cooking recipes in simple words.</li>
</ul>.
