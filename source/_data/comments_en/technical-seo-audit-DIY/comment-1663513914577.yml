  Hello! 

  Alas, I won't be able to personally respond to anyone, as I won't see the email. It is immediately hashed and stored that way on GitHub.

  The commenting system (Staticman) tries to use this hash to find a gravatar. I have my own instance of Staticman for this blog, so I can get rid of the email field entirely.
  But I don't want to change something that works well. If Heroku kills the free dynos, then maybe I'll change something.
